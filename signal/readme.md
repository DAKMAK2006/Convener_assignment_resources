# Modulated Audio Signal Processing Task

## Overview of my solution
This question took me literally 5 to 6 hrs to solve because of the theory i had to do the chat gpt for. I tried my best to guess the output but was earned a really awkard laugh then i tried by asking the bhaiya and they said two things either my code is wrong or I'm socially awkward it turns out it was the second one. The audio was Andrew garfield freaky laugh i got it at the rightest original frequency. There is cloudiness due to phase shift but its fine cause laugh is recongisable. I got to learn a lot of new things and also got the gist of what is it that i am going to experience in the ERC.

## What I did?

### 1. In code:
- I used the exact modules u told me i.e. numpy, scipy and matplotlib
- I had taken help from gpt in creating the bandpass filter and then a guy told me and some other students to try to adjust the frequency around the carrier frequency to get the accurate laugh and i got it so I'm seriously happy right now!!!!
- I had a folder named sweeped outputs to get all the 500 Hz shifted graphs but no worries i'll be uploading the crrect graph and audio only.


### 2. In theory:
- I first learned about what is Amplitude Modification then learnt about what is Fast Fourier Transform and also the bandpass filter But i guess i failed to understand what is exactly a filter and then also about the working of a filter so it was skipped by me.
- During the writing of the code i came across several other things like carrier wave should be cos or sin as extra frequency term would be there by using sin wave as the carrier then learnt about Nyquist frequency or what should be the cutoff frequency.
- I also learnt the the signals should be normalized and also looked for a certain period only.

## Conclusion
I enjoyed the process, skipped some part to save some time but in the end tried to grasp whatever i could from this question and ofcourse the biggest one was Fourier transform which was unknown to me untill now as now i have learned really something and also got the application for it.

Thanks for this question!!!
